<h3> Naruto </h3>
<p> Nothing compares to Naruto. Simply the greatest anime with the best fight scenes, protagonists, antagonists and so much more! </p>
<h3> One Punch Man  </h3>
<p> One of the strongest anime characters of all time is in this show (Saitama)</p>
<h3> Death Note </h3>
<p> An intellectual masterpiece. One of the most unsatisfying endings in Anime history though. </p>
